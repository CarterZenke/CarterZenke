## Carter Zenke

I teach as a Senior Instructor in Computer Science at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu). As academic head of [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/), I oversee educational productions and operations for CS50's 5M+ students, online and on-campus. With CS50's team of producers, I recently created our [Introduction to Databases with SQL](https://cs50.harvard.edu/sql) and am now teaching our new [Introduction to Programming with R](https://cs50.harvard.edu/r), both freely available online.

I have also recently made technical and pedagogical contributions to [https://cs50.ai/](https://cs50.ai/), the learnings from which we will [present at SIGCSE 2024](https://cs.harvard.edu/malan/publications/V1fp0567-liu.pdf).
